# SpeakeSystem: an autonomous music improviser

This repository contains items which relate to an autonomous music improviser developed by Matthew Yee-King in Summer 2015 for a performance that took place at the Wellcome Trust in London on  the 26th September 2015. British Saxophonist Martin Speake performed live with the system and the performance was broadcast live on BBC Radio 3. 

The performance was later analysed through annotation and tagging. 

The repository contains the following items:

* Supercollider code including the main system and supporting classes.
* A recording of the performance in FLAC format.
* A dataset comprising a set of time-region linked annotations made by the system architect, Martin Speake and Mark d'Inverno.
* Some documentation of the event including a photo and a screen shot of the BBC website.
* Code and data file to generate a visual ontology of the comments.
